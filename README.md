# Subject : Based on this Customer Personality Analysis Data, is there any different pattern of acceptance should customer differentiate by Generattion Type? 

# Customer segmentation by Generation: 
1. Generation Builder       : Born between 1928 -  1945
2. Generation Baby Boomers  : Born between 1946 -  1964
3. Generation X             : Born between 1965 -  1980
4. Generation Y / Millenial : Born between 1981 -  1996
5. Generation Z             : Born between 1997 -  2012

# Step of the Process
1. Data understanding
2. Data Cleaning in Python : lower alphabetic, checking NaN, simplifying column, customer gereation added, etc
3. Data Statistic in Python : Distribution check, Heatmap for correlation, (X,y) Split, Numerical & Categorical separation, scaling & encoder 
4. Data Modelling in Python : Logistic Regression & Smote
5. Data Saving to CSV for reading in SQL and Tableau
6. Data Interpretation using Tableau and saving it in Tableau Public

# Data Summary 
Based on actual data there is 2 type of customer : the on that rejecting and the other that accepting the marketing campaign.
Sample shown that there is 3 major generation to check : Baby Boomers, Generation X and generation Y / Millenial
Resume for Customer that rejecting the marketing campaign: 
1. There is no special pattern between those generation : income Their pattern from 41 K  to 55 K per year, most of them are in relation and have children & their expense around 400 with purchase from store
2. Suggestion : As they are educated, need to find out their interest beside relation and the children & make a marketing campaign more interesting especially in store and website so they are intriguing and grab the product
Resume for Customer that accepting the marketing campaign : 
1. Again there is no special pattern between those generation : Higher income starting 60 K above per year, family situation still in relation but a lot that did not  have children & their expense is doubling around 1 K monthly with mostly purchase from store and high website purchase
2. Suggestion : As they are more educated due to high PhD, again qualitative research are needed  to find out their interest  & make a marketing campaign more interesting especially in website so they are intriguing and grab the product
